Prüfer twice visited Sichuan Province to research the mechanisms behind human-pollinated fruit trees that have been developed due to the virtual extinction of the insect population as a result of the overuse of pesticides. During these visits, the artist researched how the farmers in Sichuan have adapted to the reduced biological diversity by developing methods to manually pollinate flowers in order to maintain the food web. Using rudimentary tools, composed of bamboo sticks with chicken feathers attached to the ends, workers distribute pollen to individual blossoms. Prüfer documented the entire process of this manual pollination from the “painting’’ of the pollen on the blossoms to the physical labor required to transport the fruits from the valley through photographs, film, and collected objects."

The main protagonist is the fragrant nutmeg spice and its environments—such as the nutmeg pigeon, tropical rainforests, the Dutch East Indies Company, colonial explorers and their narrations, exoticism, the legends of spice, and the exploitations that accompanied the lucrative corporate colonial system. Diasporae merges fantastical tales in a video exploring botanical reproduction, time lapses, herbal seduction, seed dispersal, and plant migration, with two large drawings depicting the violent spice history that is still taken for granted, as well as the legends of the Pausengi tree and the mythical creature Garuda. <br> Displayed together in a Chinese wedding bed where fragrant mace float in the air supported by ventilators, the installation is an attempt to approach both other-than-human and Eurocentric-historical narratives through the practice of becoming diasporic."

Later in life, she published a series of books that were either co-edited with or illustrated by her son Dorion Sagan (b. 1959). <br> The role of scientific illustration as a century-old art form is referenced in ponds among ponds by way of the curtain-as-membrane. Displaying a layout composed of microbial drawings made by Sagan for Margulis’s books, the curtain in the exhibition space reminds visitors that every membrane appearing to divide the inside from the outside is also a threshold densely populated by symbionts in transformation. </div>"

Thirty mu of paddy field has been transformed into a self-sufficient farming system which nurtures the linguistic and film practices of Paddyfilm. In 2015, in opposition to the drastic transformation of rural societies in China, Mao has set up a private Elaphurus Davidianus University (EDU) within Paddyfilm’s farm, and has carried out social research and education as a kind of institutional practice aimed at the new formation of rural social subjects and their relation with knowledge production.
